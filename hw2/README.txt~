For part #1, We used Eulers method to estimate the path of a falling ball in 2d. We had two two dimensional vectors. One for velocity and one for direction. Our loop calculates the values of X, Y, U, V for the x,y position and the U,V velocities in those respective positions. 

For drawing, we fill in a red 2d ball that redraws for every time step, which gives the appearence of animation, when in reality it just pauses.
